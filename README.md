# Wooflejelly

Wooflejelly is, at present, an aspirational attempt to recreate
the [SPDX-License-Diff](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-license-diff) browser plugin (apparently not actively maintained as of 2025) as an Elm application.

## Running tests

Install dependencies once using `npm install`, then run the suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

This uses Jest together with `ts-jest` to execute the TypeScript tests under the `tests/` directory.
